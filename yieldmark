# 🧠 YieldMark — Yield-Backed Prediction Markets

**YieldMark** is a decentralized prediction market where users stake **yield-bearing tokens** to forecast future events while earning **continuous yield even if their predictions are wrong**.

Unlike traditional prediction markets where you risk losing your entire stake, YieldMark routes deposits into staking protocols so funds generate passive income during the prediction period. Only bonus allocations are at risk — not the principal.

## 🌟 Key Innovation

- **💸 Predict with Yield:** Stake `stETH`, `stICP`, or `ckBTC` to vote on outcomes
- **🛡️ Capital Efficient:** Losers retain original stake + staking yield, only forfeit bonus rewards  
- **🏆 Winners Get the Pot:** Correct predictions earn yield + share of the bonus pool
- **🔗 Proven Resolution:** Markets resolve using Polymarket outcomes as truth source

---

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### **Core Smart Contract Flow**

```solidity
// User stakes prediction
function stakePrediction(marketId, choice, amount) {
  // Split deposit: 90% to yield, 10% to bonus pool
  stakingAmount = amount * 0.9;
  bonusAmount = amount * 0.1;
  
  // Route to yield protocol (Lido, stICP, etc.)
  yieldProtocol.deposit(stakingAmount);
  bonusPool[marketId][choice] += bonusAmount;
}

// Market resolution via webhook
function resolveMarket(marketId, winningChoice) {
  totalYield = yieldProtocol.getYieldEarned(startTime, now);
  
  // Winners: stake + yield + bonus share
  // Losers: stake + yield only
  distributePayouts(marketId, winningChoice, totalYield);
}
```

### **Yield Integration Strategy**

| Asset | Protocol | APY Range | Risk Level |
|-------|----------|-----------|------------|
| `stETH` | Lido Ethereum Staking | 3-5% | Low |
| `stICP` | Internet Computer Staking | 8-12% | Medium |
| `ckBTC` | Bitcoin Yield Strategies | 2-4% | Low |

## 🚀 Implementation Plan

### **Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)**

**1. Polymarket Integration**
```typescript
// Fetch popular markets
const markets = await polymarketAPI.getPopularMarkets({
  category: 'crypto',
  status: 'active',
  limit: 20
});

// Populate database
await db.markets.createMany(markets.map(transformMarket));
```

**2. Outcome Monitoring Service**
```typescript
// Check every 2 seconds for resolution changes
setInterval(async () => {
  const updates = await polymarketAPI.checkResolutions();
  
  for (const update of updates) {
    if (update.resolved && !db.isResolved(update.id)) {
      await triggerResolutionWebhook(update);
    }
  }
}, 2000);
```

**3. Smart Contract Development**
- Deploy YieldMark core contract
- Integrate with Lido stETH initially  
- Implement basic staking/resolution logic
- Add emergency pause mechanisms

### **Phase 2: Core Features (Weeks 5-8)**

**4. Frontend Development**
- Market browsing interface
- Stake prediction flow
- Portfolio dashboard with yield tracking
- Real-time updates via WebSocket

**5. Multi-Asset Support**
- Add stICP integration (Internet Computer)
- ckBTC yield strategies
- Dynamic APY display per asset

**6. Testing & Security**
- Comprehensive smart contract testing
- Frontend integration testing
- Security audit preparation

### **Phase 3: Launch & Scale (Weeks 9-12)**

**7. Mainnet Deployment**
- Deploy to Ethereum mainnet
- Start with 3-5 popular crypto markets
- Limited beta with selected users

**8. Growth Features**
- Reputation NFTs for prediction accuracy
- Leaderboards and social features
- Mobile-responsive interface

**9. Advanced Markets**
- Custom market creation
- Cross-chain support (Polygon, Arbitrum)
- Independent oracle integration
